The HalfBridge library makes it easy to use a SN754419 dual half-bridge
motor controller to control two motors from an Arduino.

This is a very cheap way to control motors -- the chip costs under $2,
versus about $50 for an Arduino motor shield.
So it's great for classrooms or any other situation where you need lots
of motors controlled.

Copy the HalfBridge folder into your sketchbook/libraries, then use it
as shown in the halfbridge.ino applet.

Have fun!
